# EP Archéométal
You are in the repository of a group project for the INSA fourth year. It is developped by 4 people of 2025 INSA Rennes promotion
## Description
 An 3D environment to help archeologist better study artifacts, with their tools integrated:
 + Mesh visualization
 + Zooming on specific detail
 + Cntting planes
 + Hide/Display only certain details for focused study
 + Details annotation
## Demos
### Clipping planes

### General object manipulation

### Details annotation

## Context
The project take place in a collaboration between INRAP (Institut national de l'archéologie préventive) and IRISA (Institut de recherche en
informatique et systèmes aléatoires) 
For the first time in France, two big deposits in a ceramic have been discovered in a fortified house in Jenzat (Allier) Each one has been 
extract in block to keep relations to keep accessible the organisation of the objects one to the other
## State of the art
We can take experiences from the precedents practicle studies, as the Momie project, and from Introspect (http://introspect.info/)
## Goal
We aim to develop an interactive XR application to vizualize, manipulate and give additionnal informations on the archeological objects
## Students
The project is developped by 4 INSA students : Dorian Humeau, Thibaut Raoul, Thanh-Tung Vu and Matthieu Hillairet
## Supervisor
Ronan Gaugne (IRISA) and Théophane Nicolas (INRAP) will frame this project
## Subject
You can view in this directory the original subject for the practical study
