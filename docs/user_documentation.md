# User documentation
The proposed software aims to allow archaeologists and the general public to visualize, manipulate and analyze an archaeological deposit.

It brings new perspectives to characterize the gestures and modalities of constitution of non funerary deposits.

The discovery of metallic deposits in context, taken in blocks, gives the opportunity to implement a study protocol able to preserve a maximum of information on complex organized sets, sometimes composite, made up of objects combining ceramics, metals, glass, amber and organic or disappeared remains (organic container, textile...).

Knowing that in this questioning, there are multiple objectives, as for example:

- Not to lose the information delivered by the ground;
- To document in a perennial way fragile vestiges, not very manipulable, even for some, almost impossible to preserve (in particular the arrangement...);
- Implement adequate conservation measures according to the observations.

This document is a user's manual which aims to show the correct use of the proposed software.
## Hardware and software requirements
### Hardware requirements
The user must have an HTC Vive (or HTC Vive pro) virtual reality headset and two HTC controllers. The software must be used on a computer with hardware powerful enough to use a virtual reality headset (e.g. powerful dedicated graphics card).
### Software requirements
The computer must have at least the *Microsoft Windows 10* operating system, up-to-date drivers (including the virtual reality headset). The *Steam VR* software must be installed on the computer to be able to launch the program. To install *Steam VR*, please refer to one's user manual. 
## Launching the program
To launch the program, run the executable ```Archeo.exe```.

## Using the program
### Presentation of the scene
The scene takes place in a laboratory environment. A table is in the center of the room. Archological objects are placed on this table.
### Handling of objects
Global deposit and individual objects can be taken and moved by user.
### Use of clipping plans
Three clipping plans can be used by user. Each plan is distinguished with a color : Red, Green, Blue. Each plan can be taken and placed where ever to cut any object. The result is displayed on screens on the back wall (with colors to simplify location).
### Viewing information about an object
Where clicking on an object, informations are displayed on a mask at the back of the table. USer can see the name of the object, the one's id and description. A media (image, microscopic view) can also be displayed as metadata.
### Conditioned display of objects
To see only one object of a category, user can select a tag (or more) in the mask at the right of the table. As result : objects not related to this tag disapear and others stay.
