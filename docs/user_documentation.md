# User documentation
The proposed software aims to allow archaeologists and the general public to visualize, manipulate and analyze an archaeological deposit.

It brings new perspectives to characterize the gestures and modalities of constitution of non funerary deposits.

The discovery of metallic deposits in context, taken in blocks, gives the opportunity to implement a study protocol able to preserve a maximum of information on complex organized sets, sometimes composite, made up of objects combining ceramics, metals, glass, amber and organic or disappeared remains (organic container, textile...).

Knowing that in this questioning, there are multiple objectives, as for example:

- Not to lose the information delivered by the ground;
- To document in a perennial way fragile vestiges, not very manipulable, even for some, almost impossible to preserve (in particular the arrangement...);
- Implement adequate conservation measures according to the observations.

This document is a user's manual which aims to show the correct use of the proposed software.
